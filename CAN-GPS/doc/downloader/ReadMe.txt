PCAN-Flash must be started from a data carrier which is also writable, otherwise the program's configuration (PcanFlash.ini file) cannot be saved. The program doesn't work properly if it is run from a DVD. This is reflected, for example, by and error message when selecting a CAN connection.

Make sure that the PCAN-Flash directory is located on a local hard disk, for example, (if necessary, copy it from DVD) and that there are write permissions in the directory, and execute PCAN-Flash (PcanFlash.exe) from there.
